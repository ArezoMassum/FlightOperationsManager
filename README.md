# FlightOperationsManager

In this assignment, I am asked to build a flight operations management program which prints the shortest path between given two cities, number of cities we need to go through to reach the destination and total time. To create it, I used Dijkstra algorithm. On the other hand, I used arraylist to reconstruct the path as well as a method which calculates the waiting time with respect to running/loading mode of the airports.
